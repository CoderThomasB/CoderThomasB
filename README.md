- 👋 Hi, I’m Thomas Booker
- 👀 I’m interested in general computer programing in java, JavaScript, c and html.
I am currently working on personal projects to create my own object oriented programming language.
I also like doing stuff related to rendering and game engines; I am planning to make a simple 3D game engine
in openGL using java with lwjgl or if my programming language works I will use that.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small, intresting and usfull projects.
