- 👋 Hi, I’m Thomas Booker
- 👀 I’m interested in general computer programing in Vala, C and GObject. I also do a small bit of java, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
I have done some small contributions to the Gnome desktop environment and Phosh https://gitlab.gnome.org/CoderThomasB.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small, interesting and useful projects.
